    <h2 id="philosophy-title">Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Unix taught me that small, composable tools outperform monoliths.
        The demoscene proved that constraints breed elegance — 4 kilobytes
        can hold an entire world if every byte earns its place.</p>
    <p>I apply both to professional software: root-cause over symptom treatment,
        precise terminology, no corporate fluff. A Fetch API call is not AJAX.
        A modal dialogue is not "a modal".</p>

    <h2 id="path-title">The Path</h2>
    <p>Started coding at age four on a Commodore. Hobby Unix and Linux user
        before it became a career. 26 years of professional software development
        across system architecture, performance engineering, and full-stack work.</p>
    <p>Stations along the way: MMSAG, BuBe, FENEAS, EDU.CON, my own company
        (Collecting GmbH), Megaspace, ThinkLink, and HORNBACH. Each shaped the
        conviction that the best code is the code you did not write.</p>

<section class="vv-section" aria-labelledby="scene-title">
    <h2 id="scene-title">Demoscene</h2>
    <p>The demoscene is where art meets constraint. 4K intros, 64K demos,
        tracker music — maximum expression from minimum resources.
        It is not nostalgia. It is a design discipline.</p>
    <p>That mindset runs through everything I build: if the solution is
        larger than it needs to be, the solution is wrong.</p>

    <h2 id="philosophy-title">Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Unix taught me that small, composable tools outperform monoliths.
        The demoscene proved that constraints breed elegance: four kilobytes
        can hold an entire world if every byte earns its place.</p>
    <p>I apply both to professional software: root-cause over symptom treatment,
        precise terminology, no corporate fluff. A Fetch API call is not AJAX.
        A modal dialogue is not "a modal".</p>

    <h2 id="scene-title">Demoscene</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Babelsberg, Germany's historic film city, I knew people in the scene. Watched demos
        render, listened to tracker music, composed some of our own.
        Pinball machines in the background, CB radio as the communication channel.
        Greetings go out to Frosch and Piranha.</p>
    <p>The demoscene is where art meets constraint. 4K intros, 64K demos,
        tracker music: maximum expression from minimum resources.
        It is not nostalgia. It is a design discipline.</p>
    <p>That mindset runs through everything I build: if the solution is
        larger than it needs to be, the solution is wrong.</p>

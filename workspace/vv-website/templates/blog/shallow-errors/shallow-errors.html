        <h1>Shallow Errors</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="vv-article-body">
        <p>In 2013, a German data scientist named
            <a href="https://www.dkriesel.com/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_teleportieren_zahlen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Kriesel</a>
            discovered something rather unsettling about Xerox WorkCentre
            scanners: they were silently changing numbers in scanned documents.
            A 7 became an 8. No error message. No warning. No red flag of any
            kind. Just a quiet substitution, filed away and forwarded to the
            next person in the chain.</p>

        <p>The cause was
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBIG2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JBIG2 compression</a>,
            which uses pattern matching to reduce file size. When two characters
            look sufficiently similar, the algorithm treats them as identical.
            The 7 looked enough like an 8 &#x2014; to the algorithm, not to any
            human &#x2014; and so the 8 it became. Years of invoices, construction
            plans, medical records, and tax documents were corrupted before
            anyone noticed. Because, of course, the output looked perfectly
            normal.</p>

        <p>That is the distinguishing feature of a shallow error: it passes
            inspection.</p>

        <h2>The Fluent Mistranslation</h2>

        <p>Fast-forward to the present. DeepL translates "composability" as
            "Kombinierbarkeit" &#x2014; combinability. Close. Plausible. The sort
            of thing a reviewer who is not a domain specialist would wave
            through without a second glance. And so it propagates: through
            technical documentation, review cycles, international teams.
            Everyone reads fluently. Nobody notices the semantic drift.</p>

        <p>"Composability" is a precise term. It means the ability of
            components to be assembled into larger structures whilst retaining
            their individual interfaces &#x2014; a property central to Unix
            philosophy, functional programming, and modular system design.
            "Combinability" merely means things can be put together. A bag of
            Lego is combinable. Unix pipes are composable. The distinction
            matters, but only to people who know what they are looking for.
            Everyone else reads on, satisfied.</p>

        <p>We laugh at badly translated Chinese instruction manuals. "Do not
            the cat ironing." Splendid. But those are the <em>safe</em> errors
            &#x2014; so obviously wrong that they invite scepticism by default.
            Nobody reads "Please to enjoy the happy washing experience" and
            trusts the electrical safety instructions that follow. The absurdity
            is its own warning label.</p>

        <p>The fluent mistranslation is the dangerous one. It passes review
            precisely because it reads well.</p>

        <h2>The Error Spectrum</h2>

        <p>Not all errors are created equal, and the ones we worry about
            least are frequently the ones that cause the most damage.</p>

        <p>On the left: errors that announce themselves. A syntax error halts
            the build. A 500 status code triggers the on-call rota. A garbled
            translation provokes laughter, then correction. These are loud
            failures. They cost time, never trust.</p>

        <p>On the right: errors that arrive dressed for the occasion. A number
            that has been quietly swapped. A term that has been subtly shifted.
            A paragraph that reads beautifully and says something almost, but
            not quite, correct. These are shallow errors. They cost trust,
            eventually. By the time anyone notices, the damage has compounded.</p>

        <h2>Coherence Engines</h2>

        <p>Simon Wardley's observation about large language models is worth
            stating plainly: they are
            <em>coherence engines, not truth engines</em>. Their function is to
            produce output that reads as plausible. Not output that is correct
            &#x2014; output that <em>sounds</em> correct. The distinction is the
            entire problem.</p>

        <p>A coherence engine and a pattern-matching compressor have more in
            common than one might suppose. JBIG2 looked at a 7, compared it
            statistically to an 8, and concluded they were close enough. An LLM
            looks at "composability," compares it statistically to its nearest
            neighbours in the target language, and concludes "Kombinierbarkeit"
            is close enough. Both systems optimise for plausibility. Neither
            system has a mechanism for semantic verification. The error surface
            is identical: the output looks right, nobody checks, and the
            corruption propagates.</p>

        <aside>
            <p>David Kriesel's investigation is worth the detour. He
                discovered that JBIG2 compression in Xerox scanners used
                pattern matching that treated visually similar characters as
                identical &#x2014; the same principle, at a different scale, that
                makes LLMs produce statistically close but conceptually
                different output. "Composability" and "Kombinierbarkeit" are
                statistically adjacent in the training data. They are not
                synonyms in any engineering context that matters.</p>
        </aside>

        <h2>The Missing Assertion</h2>

        <p>Test-driven development introduced a discipline that software
            engineering now takes for granted: the assertion. An explicit
            expectation, stated in code, that fails loudly when reality
            diverges from intent. The entire value of a test suite lies not
            in the tests that pass, but in the tests that <em>don't</em> &#x2014;
            because a loud failure is a caught failure.</p>

        <p>Translation has no such mechanism. Neither does most AI-generated
            content. There is no assertion layer between the output and the
            consumer. No <code>expect(translation).toPreserveSemantics()</code>.
            The reviewer is the test suite, and the reviewer &#x2014; being human,
            being busy, being presented with fluent prose &#x2014; is precisely
            the sort of test suite that waves green on plausibility alone.</p>

        <p>TDD gave software engineering its rigour through one simple
            insight: make the failure visible. The shallow error is dangerous
            precisely because nothing in the pipeline is designed to surface
            it.</p>

        <h2>The Uncomfortable Implication</h2>

        <p>We have built an industry around loud errors. Linters, type
            checkers, continuous integration, monitoring dashboards, alerting
            systems &#x2014; all of them optimised for failures that announce
            themselves. We are exceptionally good at catching the errors that
            were never going to cause lasting damage in the first place.</p>

        <p>The shallow errors &#x2014; the ones that read well, that pass review,
            that propagate through documentation and decision-making and
            downstream systems &#x2014; have no tooling. No pipeline. No dashboard.
            They survive precisely because they do not trigger anything.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The dangerous errors are not the ones that fail loudly.
                They are the ones that read well.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>A badly translated manual is a joke. A fluently mistranslated
            specification is a lawsuit. The distance between the two is not
            quality &#x2014; it is visibility.</p>

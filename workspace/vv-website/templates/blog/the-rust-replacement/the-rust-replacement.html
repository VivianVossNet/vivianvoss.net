        <p><em>The Replacement</em> &#x25A0; Episode 05</p>

        <p>After twenty years of PHP, I needed something new for
            backend work. The obvious choice, according to the
            consensus, was Go. Everyone said so. The job listings said
            so. The conference talks said so. I looked at Go. I spent
            two weeks with it. I chose Rust instead.</p>

        <p>This is not a theoretical comparison. This is the reasoning
            of someone who writes server software for a living and had
            to pick a tool for the next decade.</p>

        <h2>Why Not Go</h2>

        <p>Go felt like a step sideways. Yes, it compiles to a single
            binary. Yes, it is fast. But the details accumulated into
            a pattern that I recognised from languages I was trying to
            leave behind.</p>

        <p>The garbage collector. Someone else deciding when to pause
            your programme. That is the programming equivalent of a
            flatmate who takes out the rubbish whenever <em>they</em>
            feel like it, not when the bin is actually full. You have
            no control over the timing, no control over the duration,
            and the pause happens precisely when you can least afford
            it: under load.</p>

        <p><code>if err != nil</code> in every second line. Error
            handling from the 1970s, without the excuse of the 1970s.
            No enums. No sum types. No pattern matching. Generics
            arrived in 2022, a decade late and half-baked. The language
            calls this &#x201C;simplicity.&#x201D; What it actually
            does is push complexity into your application code, where
            it is harder to audit and easier to get wrong.</p>

        <h2>Why Rust</h2>

        <p>Rust felt like a step forward. The first thing you notice
            is the compiler. It does not merely reject your code. It
            <em>teaches</em> you.</p>

        <p>It tells you what is wrong. It tells you <em>why</em> it
            is wrong. It tells you how to fix it. It gives you the
            example code. Which other language does that? C gives you
            &#x201C;Segmentation fault&#x201D; and wishes you luck.
            C++ template errors span five hundred lines. Go says
            <code>err != nil</code> and leaves you alone. PHP gives
            you a stack trace if you are lucky.</p>

        <p>Rust refuses to compile until your code is correct. That
            is not a steep learning curve. That is a safety net with
            instructions.</p>

        <h2>The Learning Curve</h2>

        <p>&#x201C;But Rust is hard!&#x201D; I hear this constantly.
            Allow me to offer a different perspective.</p>

        <p>Week one and two: fighting the borrow checker. The compiler
            rejects your code with messages that are, admittedly,
            unfamiliar. You are accustomed to languages that accept
            your code now and punish you later. Rust punishes you now
            and accepts your code later. The adjustment is real. It
            is also temporary.</p>

        <p>Week three: something clicks. Ownership, borrowing,
            lifetimes, these are not arbitrary obstacles. They are the
            rules that every other language enforces at runtime, with
            garbage collectors, with null pointer exceptions, with
            segmentation faults. Rust enforces them at compile time.
            The information is the same. The timing is different. And
            the timing is better.</p>

        <p>After that: you do not want to go back. Once you have a
            compiler that prevents data races, null pointer
            dereferences, use-after-free errors, and buffer overflows
            <em>before</em> your code runs, every other language feels
            like driving without a seatbelt.</p>

        <h2>The Numbers</h2>

        <p>PHP-FPM allocates approximately 40 MB of RAM per worker
            process. A hundred concurrent requests means four gigabytes
            of RAM consumed by PHP alone, before your application has
            done anything interesting. Rust with
            <a href="https://tokio.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokio</a>,
            the async runtime, handles the same workload in
            approximately 150 MB total. That is a twentieth of the
            memory for the same job.</p>

        <p>The arithmetic extends to server costs. If your PHP
            application needs a server with 16 GB of RAM, your Rust
            application needs one with 1 GB. If your PHP application
            needs four servers, your Rust application needs one. The
            reduction compounds with scale, and scale is where the
            invoices become interesting.</p>

        <h2>The Ecosystem</h2>

        <p>&#x201C;But can I replace everything PHP does?&#x201D;
            Yes. <a href="https://actix.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Actix</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axum</a>,
            Rocket, mature web frameworks. Diesel, SQLx, database
            access with compile-time query checking. MiniJinja, Tera,
            Askama, templating engines. Serde, serialisation that is
            faster than most languages&#x2019; built-in JSON parsers.
            The
            <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow survey</a>
            has named Rust the most admired language for eight
            consecutive years. The ecosystem is not catching up. It
            has caught up.</p>

        <h2>The Reduction</h2>

        <p>No null. No exceptions. No garbage collector pauses. No
            runtime dependencies. One binary. Copy it to the server.
            Run it. There is no interpreter to install, no runtime to
            version-manage, no dependency tree to resolve at
            deployment time. The binary is the deployment. The
            deployment is a file copy.</p>

        <p>The Rust compiler taught me more about programming than
            any book. Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, these are not
            Rust-specific concepts. They are universal concepts that
            other languages let you ignore. Rust does not let you
            ignore them. That is not a weakness. That is the point.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>No null. No exceptions. No garbage collector. One binary.
                A twentieth of the memory. The compiler as private tutor.
                Rust is not hard. It is honest. And honesty, in the long
                run, is cheaper than pretending.</p>
        </blockquote>

            <p><strong>On the borrow checker</strong></p>
            <p>The borrow checker is the most misunderstood feature in
                modern programming. It does not restrict what you can do.
                It prevents you from doing things that are always wrong:
                using freed memory, mutating shared state, racing between
                threads. Every other language allows these bugs and
                catches them at runtime, if at all. Rust catches them
                at compile time. The learning curve is real. The payoff
                is permanent. Source:

    <div class="vv-article-body">
        <p>Over the past eight episodes of this series, we have dissected individual
            performance problems: the event loop, the dependency graph, the virtual DOM,
            the cloud invoice. Each one appeared to be its own isolated pathology. But
            stand back far enough and a shape emerges. The same shape, every time.</p>

        <p>Today we name it.</p>

        <h2>Four Exhibits</h2>

        <p><strong>Node.js</strong> is built around a single-threaded event loop &#x2014;
            a concurrency model that was already considered a pragmatic compromise in the
            1980s. The prescribed remedy is horizontal scaling: spin up more processes,
            more containers, more machines. This remedy, in turn, spawned an entire
            orchestration industry &#x2014; Kubernetes, service meshes, observability
            platforms &#x2014; each solving a problem that exists only because the
            original tool chose not to.</p>

        <p><strong>npm</strong> ships without proper dependency resolution, a problem most
            package managers solved comfortably in the 1990s. The workaround is lock files,
            security scanners, and audit tooling. The resulting gap created a lucrative
            security-as-a-service market &#x2014; Snyk, Dependabot, and their many
            competitors &#x2014; all sustained by the dependency chaos they were hired
            to tame.</p>

        <p><strong>React's Virtual DOM</strong> introduces a diffing layer to solve a
            DOM update problem that browsers already handle natively. The prescribed
            remedy is memoisation, profiling, and increasingly baroque build pipelines.
            This spawned an ecosystem of DevTools extensions, framework consultancies,
            and conference circuits dedicated to explaining why your application is
            slow and what you might purchase to make it less so.</p>

        <p><strong>Cloud pricing</strong> is deliberately opaque. Forty-seven-page
            invoices that require a new professional discipline &#x2014; FinOps &#x2014;
            merely to decode. The workaround is cost-optimisation tooling and dedicated
            specialists. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-01-21-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-9-point-8-percent-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner estimates</a>
            that 30% of cloud spend is pure waste. Naturally, the cure for this
            waste is yet more tooling.</p>

        <p>One might notice a pattern emerging.</p>

        <h2>The Mechanism</h2>

        <p>Strip away the product names and release dates, and each case follows
            the same four-step cycle:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Introduce a tool with a fundamental limitation.</li>
            <li>Present the workaround as industry best practice.</li>
            <li>Build an ecosystem that profits from the resulting complexity.</li>
            <li>Repeat until sunk cost makes switching unthinkable.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The limitation is not a bug. It is rather good business, actually.</p>

        <p>This is not a conspiracy theory. No one sat in a room and planned it. The
            mechanism is subtler than that: a design trade-off becomes an industry
            default, the default creates demand for remediation, and remediation
            creates stakeholders who have no interest in the problem being solved
            at the root. Incentives do the rest. No malice required.</p>

        <h2>The Second Loop</h2>

        <p>The cycle does not stop at lock-in. It compounds. Consider what happens
            when the workaround for a single-threaded server is to decompose
            everything into microservices:</p>

        <p>More services means more network communication. More network communication
            means more attack surface. More attack surface demands more security tooling.
            More security tooling means more complexity. More complexity means &#x2014;
            one hardly needs to finish the sentence.</p>

        <p>Spot the beneficiary.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-01-21-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-9-point-8-percent-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner expects</a>
            global cybersecurity spending to reach approximately &#x20AC;197 billion in
            2025. An industry that grows precisely because the architecture it protects
            was designed to be indefensible. Rather elegant, if one is selling the cure.</p>

        <h2>The Invoice</h2>

        <p>Consider the past eight years alone. According to
            <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/it-tech-spending.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte's benchmarks</a>,
            IT spending as a percentage of revenue has nearly doubled: from 3.28% in
            2016 to 5.85% in 2024 &#x2014; a 78% increase. The tooling, we are
            assured, got better. Marvellous.</p>

        <aside>
            <p>The trajectory in detail: 3.28% in 2016, 4.25% by 2020, 5.85% by
                2024. In banking, the figure reaches
                <a href="https://avasant.com/it-spending-and-staffing-benchmarks-2024-2025-chapter-1-executive-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.4% of revenue</a>.
                These figures exclude shadow IT and departmental SaaS subscriptions.
                The actual number is rather higher.</p>
        </aside>

        <p>Every workaround demands headcount. Every headcount demands coordination.
            Every coordination layer demands its own tooling. Eventually, you are
            not a product company with IT support. You are an IT company that
            occasionally ships product.</p>

        <p>One does wonder at what percentage the board might begin to notice.</p>

        <h2>The Counter-Evidence</h2>

        <p>If this cycle were inevitable &#x2014; if every tool must spawn an industry
            of apologies &#x2014; then we would expect no exceptions. But exceptions
            are precisely what we find, and they have been hiding in plain sight
            for decades.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a></strong>
            has been in continuous development for 35 years. It does not require a
            constellation of third-party tools to compensate for design decisions
            it got wrong in 1989. It simply got them right.</p>

        <p><strong>SQLite</strong> consists of three files and zero external dependencies.
            It is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. No one has
            built a consultancy around making SQLite bearable.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeBSD Jails</a></strong>
            have provided kernel-native process isolation since the year 2000 &#x2014;
            three years before the term "containerisation" acquired its current
            meaning and a full thirteen years before Docker appeared. No orchestration
            layer required. No YAML liturgy.</p>

        <p><strong>Go</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong> handle concurrency at the
            language level: goroutines, ownership, lifetimes. No framework gymnastics.
            No horizontal scaling to paper over a single-threaded design.</p>

        <p>None of these spawned billion-euro industries dedicated to patching their
            shortcomings. They simply work. Boring technology, it turns out, does not
            require an industry to support it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>That is rather the point.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Uncomfortable Question</h2>

        <p>The pattern is not difficult to see. It is difficult to act upon, because
            acting upon it means questioning sunk costs, retraining teams, and
            disappointing vendors whose revenue depends on the status quo.</p>

        <p>But the arithmetic is patient. A tool that solves the problem it creates
            is not a tool. It is a subscription. And the difference between engineering
            and subsidy is whether the spend converges or diverges.</p>

        <p>Thirty-five years of PostgreSQL converge. Eight years of doubling IT
            budgets diverge. The maths is not ambiguous. Only the incentives are.</p>

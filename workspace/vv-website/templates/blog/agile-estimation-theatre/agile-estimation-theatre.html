        <p><em>The Copy Cat</em> &#x25A0; Episode 03</p>

        <p>Late 1990s. Ron Jeffries and Kent Beck are estimating user
            stories in Extreme Programming. They use "Ideal Days": how
            long would this take if nobody interrupted, no meetings
            happened, and the laws of thermodynamics briefly paused?</p>

        <p>Managers kept asking why an "ideal day" took three real days.
            Rather persistently.</p>

        <p>The solution was elegant in the way that avoidance often is:
            stop calling them days. Call them "points." Nobody asks
            awkward questions about a "point." What is a point? It is a
            point. How long is a point? It is not time. It is relative
            size. Points compared to other points. A 5-point story is
            roughly twice a 3-point story. No hours. No calendars. Just
            sorting.</p>

        <p>Ron Jeffries,
            <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/019-01ff/story-points/Index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>:
            "I may have invented story points, and if I did, I'm sorry
            now."</p>

        <h2>The Original</h2>

        <p>Story points, in their original form, were relative sizes.
            Not measurements. Not commitments. Certainly not deadlines.
            The idea was disarmingly simple: compare stories to each
            other. "This one feels roughly twice as big as that one."
            The precision was deliberate imprecision. "About the same
            size" was sufficient. The unit was meaningless by design,
            because any unit with meaning would be converted into time,
            and time would be converted into a commitment, and a
            commitment would be converted into a deadline, and a deadline
            would be missed, and a meeting would be called.</p>

        <p>Sorting. Not measuring. Quite sensible, really.</p>

        <h2>The Copy</h2>

        <p>By the mid-2000s, the industry had discovered velocity: sum
            the points completed per sprint. Plot a graph. Show it to
            management. The unit that was not time had become time.
            Marvellous.</p>

        <p>The context that got lost:</p>

        <p><strong>Original:</strong> points compared stories within a
            single team. <strong>Copy:</strong> points compare teams
            across the organisation.</p>

        <p><strong>Original:</strong> velocity was a private planning
            tool for the team. <strong>Copy:</strong> velocity is a KPI
            reported to stakeholders quarterly.</p>

        <p><strong>Original:</strong> "about the same size" was
            sufficient precision. <strong>Copy:</strong> 45-minute
            debates whether something is a 3 or a 5. A terribly
            productive use of six engineers.</p>

        <h2>The Inflation</h2>

        <p>A team's velocity rises from 30 to 50 over six months.
            Management celebrates. The team has changed nothing except
            how they estimate. What was a 3 in January is a 5 in July.
            Same task. Same effort. Higher number. Everybody claps.</p>

        <p>The system sustains itself because honesty would be more
            expensive than the fiction. Management gets rising graphs.
            The team gets left alone. The Scrum Master gets a purpose.
            Nobody will peck out the other's eye when all benefit from
            keeping it shut.</p>

        <h2>The Five-Year Plan</h2>

        <p>There is a historical precedent. The German Democratic Republic
            had five-year plans. Every factory exceeded its targets. Every
            quarter, the numbers improved. The economy collapsed anyway.
            The numbers were not measurements. They were performances.</p>

        <p>Story points are the five-year plan of software development.
            Everyone knows the numbers are performative. Everyone reports
            them. Nobody asks whether the software shipped faster. The
            ritual sustains itself because the alternative, admitting that
            estimation at this granularity is guesswork, would render a
            great deal of expensive ceremony unnecessary. And ceremony
            employs people.</p>

        <h2>The Alternative That Already Works</h2>

        <p>Ron Jeffries now suggests simply counting stories. No points.
            No poker. No theatre. How many items did the team deliver last
            sprint? Forecast from the historical rate. This is the
            <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/noestimates-software-effort-estimations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#NoEstimates</a>
            position (Woody Zuill, Vasco Duarte, 2012): throughput-based
            forecasting. Count items delivered. Plot the rate. Project
            forward. Equivalent predictability. A fraction of the
            ceremony.</p>

        <p>The objection, inevitably, is that stories vary in size. They
            do. But over a sufficiently large sample, the variance
            averages out. The same statistical principle that makes
            velocity "work" makes throughput work, without the 45-minute
            debates and without the inflation incentive.</p>

        <p>Rather less entertaining at standup. But rather more honest.</p>

            <p>A unit invented to avoid gaming became the most gamed metric
                in software. The inventor apologised. The industry carried
                on. One almost admires the irony.</p>

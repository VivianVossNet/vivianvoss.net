    </header>

    <div class="vv-article-body">
        <p><em>Divide et Impera</em> &#x25A0; Episode 01</p>

        <p>Divide and conquer. The oldest strategy of control. Fragment the
            opposition. Isolate the units. Make them dependent on coordination
            from above.</p>

        <p>Rather effective, as the Romans discovered some twenty-three centuries
            ago. It is happening in your engineering department right now. They
            call it "Agile."</p>

        <h2>The Manifesto</h2>

        <p>In February 2001, seventeen software developers gathered at a ski lodge
            in Snowbird, Utah, and wrote
            <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a manifesto</a>.
            Four values.
            <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twelve principles</a>.
            The language was deliberately humanist: <em>individuals and interactions
            over processes and tools</em>. <em>Working software over comprehensive
            documentation</em>. <em>Responding to change over following a plan</em>.</p>

        <p>These were not radical propositions. They were, in fact, so self-evidently
            sensible that one might wonder why they needed writing down at all. The
            answer, of course, is that the industry had spent the preceding decade
            doing precisely the opposite &#x2014; burying developers under process
            documentation thick enough to stop a door, then acting surprised when the
            software arrived late and broken.</p>

        <p>The manifesto was a corrective. A reminder that the people writing the
            code might, on occasion, know something about writing code.</p>

        <p>It lasted approximately four years before the management consultants
            arrived.</p>

        <h2>The Takeover</h2>

        <p>What happened next deserves a diagram, because the sheer velocity of
            the drift from idealism to industrialisation is rather difficult to
            convey in prose alone.</p>

        <p>The
            <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scrum Alliance</a>
            was founded in 2005. Within a decade, it had certified over one million
            Scrum Masters &#x2014; a professional title that did not exist before the
            manifesto's ink had dried, and whose primary qualification is a two-day
            course and a fee. By 2014, one of the manifesto's original signatories
            was already writing
            <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the eulogy</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Vocabulary Trick</h2>

        <p>The genius of the takeover &#x2014; and it is a kind of genius, however
            dispiriting &#x2014; lies in the vocabulary. Scrum did not reject the
            manifesto. It adopted the manifesto's language wholesale and quietly
            reassigned every word.</p>

        <p><em>Daily standup</em> was meant to be a brief, voluntary synchronisation
            amongst peers. It became a mandatory status report to management, held
            at a fixed time, with an implied obligation to justify yesterday's
            existence. <em>Sprint review</em> was meant to be a collaborative
            demonstration of working software. It became a performance evaluation
            with a Jira filter. <em>Story points</em> were explicitly designed to be
            relative estimates, deliberately abstract, unsuitable for cross-team
            comparison. They became productivity metrics. Naturally.</p>

        <p>The words remained. The meaning inverted.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"But we're Agile!" &#x2014; No. You are doing Taylorism in a hoodie.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Genealogy</h2>

        <p>Frederick Winslow Taylor published
            <em>The Principles of Scientific Management</em> in 1911. His central
            thesis was admirably straightforward: break work into the smallest
            measurable units, time each unit, optimise the worker. The factory
            floor as a machine. The human as a component.</p>

        <p>Scrum, a century later, breaks work into story points, times each
            sprint, and optimises the velocity. The vocabulary has changed.
            The spreadsheet has moved to the cloud. The ideology has not.</p>

        <p>Taylor at least had the decency to be honest about what he was doing.
            He called it "scientific management," which is neither particularly
            scientific nor especially manageable, but at least it does not pretend
            to be a philosophy of human empowerment. Scrum, by contrast, wraps
            identical assumptions in the language of autonomy and collaboration,
            which requires a rather more impressive suspension of disbelief.</p>

        <h2>The Feature as Casualty</h2>

        <p>Consider what happens to an actual feature under this regime. A piece
            of functionality that a single developer could design, build, and ship
            in a week gets sliced into twelve tickets across four teams. Each
            ticket must be estimated, refined, prioritised, and assigned. Nobody
            owns the whole thing. Integration is someone else's problem &#x2014;
            or, more precisely, everyone's problem, which in organisational
            practice means nobody's.</p>

        <p>You spend more time in refinement meetings than writing code. You try
            a better keyboard. A faster IDE. But none of that matters, because the
            bottleneck was never your typing speed. The point was never your
            productivity. The point is that you are measurable. Controllable.
            Trackable on a dashboard that someone three levels above you checks
            every Monday morning.</p>

        <p>You wanted to build software. Instead, you move tickets.</p>

        <h2>The Certification Economy</h2>

        <aside>
            <p>The Scrum Alliance reports
                <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over one million certified Scrum Masters</a>
                worldwide. A
                <a href="https://www.scaledagile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAFe certification</a>
                costs approximately $1,000 per person. "Agile Transformation" consulting
                is a billion-euro market. One might observe that a philosophy built on
                the rejection of heavy process has become, itself, the heaviest process
                of all.</p>
        </aside>

        <p>This is the part where the economics become instructive, because the
            corruption of Agile is not merely philosophical. It is commercial.</p>

        <p>An entire industry now exists whose revenue depends on Agile remaining
            complicated enough to require professional guidance. Certification
            bodies, transformation consultancies,
            <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conference circuits</a>,
            tooling vendors &#x2014; each with a vested interest in the proposition
            that "doing Agile properly" requires expertise that can only be
            purchased. The manifesto fits on a single page. The industry it
            accidentally spawned employs hundreds of thousands.</p>

        <p>Martin Fowler coined a useful term for this:
            <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Faux Agile</em></a>.
            The appearance of agility without the substance. Process compliance
            marketed as cultural transformation. A cargo cult with excellent
            branding.</p>

        <h2>The Inventors Speak</h2>

        <p>One might dismiss this analysis as the grumbling of someone who simply
            dislikes meetings. Fair enough. But the people who <em>wrote</em> the
            manifesto are saying the same thing, which rather complicates the
            dismissal.</p>

        <p>Dave Thomas, manifesto signatory, 2014:
            <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Agile is dead."</a>
            Not the values &#x2014; the values were always sound. The word itself.
            The brand. The industry that colonised it.</p>

        <p>Ron Jeffries, co-creator of Extreme Programming and manifesto signatory,
            2018:
            <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Developers should abandon Agile."</a>
            His reasoning is worth reading in full, but the summary is brisk: the
            practices that help developers were captured by processes that help
            managers, and the developers lost.</p>

        <p>The people who invented it are telling you it has been corrupted. But
            do carry on.</p>

        <h2>The Uncomfortable Parallel</h2>

        <p>There is a pattern here that extends beyond software methodology, and
            it is worth naming plainly. <em>Divide et impera</em> &#x2014; divide
            and rule &#x2014; works by fragmenting a coherent group into isolated
            units that cannot coordinate without permission from above.</p>

        <p>Scrum fragments a development team's autonomy into two-week increments
            that must be approved, estimated, and reported upon. It replaces trust
            with ceremony. It replaces judgement with metrics. It replaces ownership
            with ticketing. The developer who once understood a feature from
            requirements to deployment now understands a ticket from "In Progress"
            to "Done."</p>

        <p>The scope of individual agency shrinks. The surface area of management
            oversight grows. This is not a side effect. It is the mechanism.</p>

        <h2>What Remains</h2>

        <p>The manifesto's values have not expired. They were correct in 2001 and
            they are correct now. <em>Individuals and interactions over processes
            and tools</em> remains excellent advice &#x2014; advice that is
            systematically ignored by every Scrum implementation that mandates
            a daily standup, a sprint review, a retrospective, a backlog grooming
            session, and a PI planning event, all administered through Jira, which
            is itself a process tool of such baroque complexity that it requires
            its own administrator.</p>

        <p>The manifesto asked for less process. The industry responded with
            more process, rebranded as "Agile process," which is rather like
            responding to a request for silence by playing the quiet bits of
            Wagner.</p>

        <p>The remedy is not another framework. It is not SAFe, or LeSS, or
            Nexus, or Disciplined Agile, or whatever the next acronym happens
            to be. The remedy is what the manifesto said in the first place:
            trust competent people, give them a problem, get out of the way.</p>

        <p>Seventeen developers understood that in 2001. A million Scrum Masters
            later, the message appears to have been lost in translation.</p>

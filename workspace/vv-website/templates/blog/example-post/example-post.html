    <div class="vv-article-body">
        <p>This is a placeholder article. Replace this with the full text of your LinkedIn post.</p>

        <p>The demoscene taught a generation of programmers that constraint is not limitation.
            It is method. When you have four kilobytes, every instruction must justify its presence.
            There is no room for convenience abstractions or speculative generality.</p>

        <p>The same principle applies to production software. A web page that loads 3 MB of JavaScript
            to render a list is not a technical achievement. It is a failure of discipline.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>If the solution is larger than it needs to be, the solution is wrong.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is not minimalism as aesthetic. It is minimalism as engineering method.
            The smallest correct solution is, by definition, the one with the fewest failure modes.</p>

        <h2>What this means in practice</h2>

        <p>Every dependency is a liability. Every abstraction layer is a potential source of confusion.
            Every byte transferred is time your user spends waiting.</p>

        <p>The question is never "can we add this?" The question is "must we?"</p>

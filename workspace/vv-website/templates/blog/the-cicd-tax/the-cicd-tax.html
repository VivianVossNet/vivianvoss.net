        <blockquote>
            <p>&#x201C;git commit -m &#x2018;fix ci&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The most honest commit message in software engineering. Not &#x201C;refactor authentication
            module&#x201D; or &#x201C;improve performance of dashboard query.&#x201D; Just: the pipeline
            broke, and I am fixing the pipeline. Again. The code was correct. The YAML was not. Or
            rather, the YAML was correct but the indentation was wrong, which in a whitespace-sensitive
            configuration language amounts to the same thing.</p>

        <p>CI/CD &#x2014; Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment &#x2014; is the industry&#x2019;s
            answer to the question &#x201C;how do we ship software reliably?&#x201D; The answer, it
            turns out, is a forty-five-minute pipeline that runs on every pull request, consumes six
            developer-hours per day in waiting time, and costs
            <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2026/01/the-roi-of-dev-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13,445 per developer per year</a>
            in lost productivity. Let us examine the invoice.</p>

        <h2>The Waiting Tax</h2>

        <p>A developer opens a pull request. The pipeline begins. Forty-five minutes later, it
            finishes &#x2014; or fails on a flaky test that passed locally, or times out on a
            Docker layer cache that was evicted overnight, or discovers that a transitive
            dependency released a patch version that breaks the build in a way nobody could
            have predicted because nobody reads changelogs for packages four levels deep.</p>

        <p>While the pipeline runs, the developer context-switches. Picks up another ticket.
            Loses the mental model of the code they just wrote. When the pipeline finally reports
            back &#x2014; red, naturally &#x2014; the developer must reload that mental model,
            diagnose the failure, fix it, push again, and wait another forty-five minutes. Two
            cycles of this, and the morning is gone.</p>

        <p>Six hours per day. Twenty per cent of the working week. Not writing features. Not fixing
            bugs. Not thinking about architecture. Waiting for a machine to tell you what you already
            knew: the code works. According to JetBrains&#x2019; 2026 analysis of developer experience
            ROI, that waiting time costs $13,445 per developer per year. For a team of twenty, that is
            a quarter of a million dollars annually, spent watching progress bars.</p>

        <h2>The YAML Problem</h2>

        <p>The pipeline is defined in YAML. This is the first structural error. YAML is a
            serialisation format that was never designed to be a programming language, yet CI/CD
            platforms have collectively decided it should be one. It is whitespace-sensitive, which
            means a single misplaced space can invalidate the entire pipeline &#x2014; silently,
            because YAML does not throw syntax errors so much as reinterpret your intent.</p>

        <p>It is not locally testable. The feedback loop for pipeline configuration is: edit YAML,
            commit, push, wait for the runner to pick it up, wait for the execution to reach your
            change, discover the error, repeat. This is not development. This is debugging by
            deployment, which the industry spent two decades condemning before enshrining it as
            standard practice for infrastructure configuration.</p>

        <p>The file grows. Conditionals appear. Matrix builds. Caching strategies. Secrets management.
            Environment-specific overrides. What began as a ten-line build script is now a
            three-hundred-line YAML document that nobody fully understands, nobody dares refactor,
            and everyone quietly hopes will not break on the next merge to main. It is the
            <code>Makefile</code> of the cloud generation, except that <code>make</code> at
            least runs locally.</p>

        <h2>The Supply Chain</h2>

        <p>The pipeline does not merely run your code. It runs everyone else&#x2019;s. The modern
            CI/CD pipeline is a composition of third-party actions, orbs, templates, and plugins
            &#x2014; a marketplace of executable infrastructure, maintained by strangers, pinned
            (if you are fortunate) to a specific version, and granted access to your build environment,
            your secrets, and your deployment credentials.</p>

        <p>In March 2025, this arrangement produced its inevitable consequence.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mrrh-fwg8-r2c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-30066</a>:
            <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code>, a widely used GitHub Action, was compromised.
            The attack injected code that extracted CI/CD secrets &#x2014; API keys, deployment tokens,
            cloud credentials &#x2014; from the runner environment and wrote them to the build log.
            According to
            <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-actions-supply-chain-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palo Alto&#x2019;s Unit 42</a>,
            23,000 repositories were affected. Twenty-three thousand codebases, each trusting a
            third-party action with their secrets, each discovering that the trust was misplaced.</p>

        <p>The marketplace model is npm for infrastructure. The same structural defect, the same
            implicit trust model, the same inevitable breach &#x2014; except that npm packages merely
            have access to your application. CI/CD actions have access to your deployment credentials,
            your cloud accounts, and the keys to every environment you have ever configured.</p>

        <h2>The Lock-In</h2>

        <p>GitHub Actions is not GitLab CI. GitLab CI is not CircleCI. CircleCI is not Jenkins.
            Jenkins is not Buildkite. Each platform has its own configuration format, its own
            runner model, its own marketplace of plugins, and its own set of limitations that
            you discover approximately six months after committing to the platform.</p>

        <p>The migration path between any two of these systems is a full rewrite. Not of your
            application &#x2014; the application, mercifully, does not care &#x2014; but of your
            entire build, test, and deployment infrastructure. Every conditional, every cache
            strategy, every environment variable mapping, every secret reference. The YAML is
            not portable. The ecosystem is not interoperable. The abstractions do not abstract.</p>

        <p>The CI/CD market is projected to grow from
            <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/continuous-integration-tools-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.73 billion to $4.53 billion by 2030</a>.
            That growth is not driven by new capability. It is driven by lock-in. Once your pipeline
            is written in a vendor&#x2019;s dialect of YAML, the switching cost exceeds the pain of
            staying. The vendor knows this. The pricing reflects it.</p>

        <h2>The Root Cause</h2>

        <p>The CI/CD pipeline does not exist because deployment is inherently complex. It exists
            because the stack beneath it is fragile. A pipeline that takes forty-five minutes is
            not protecting you from deployment risk. It is compensating for a build system that
            cannot be trusted, a test suite that cannot be relied upon, and a dependency chain
            that nobody has audited since the project began.</p>

        <p>The pipeline is a ventilator for a patient that poisoned itself.</p>

        <p>Consider what the pipeline actually does: it installs dependencies (because the
            application cannot declare them deterministically), it compiles (because the language
            requires a build step), it runs linters (because the language permits ambiguity), it
            executes tests (because the type system does not guarantee correctness), and it deploys
            (because the server cannot pull code on its own). Each step compensates for a weakness
            elsewhere. The pipeline is not the solution. It is the symptom.</p>

        <h2>When It Is Legitimate</h2>

        <p>Fairness requires the concession. CI/CD pipelines earn their keep in specific
            circumstances, and pretending otherwise would be dishonest.</p>

        <p><strong>Regulated industries</strong> &#x2014; finance, healthcare, aerospace &#x2014; where
            an auditable, reproducible build process is not merely desirable but legally mandated.
            The pipeline becomes a compliance artefact, and the cost is the cost of doing regulated
            business. Nobody disputes this.</p>

        <p><strong>Large teams</strong> &#x2014; fifty developers or more, where the coordination
            problem genuinely exceeds what human review and trust can manage. At that scale, automated
            gates prevent the kind of integration conflicts that would otherwise consume entire
            sprint cycles.</p>

        <p><strong>Complex monorepos</strong> &#x2014; where a change in one module can break twelve
            others, and the dependency graph is too dense for manual reasoning. The pipeline becomes
            a safety net, and the net is worth its weight.</p>

        <p>For the remaining majority &#x2014; the team of eight, the service with four endpoints,
            the application that deploys once a day to a single server &#x2014; the pipeline is
            overhead dressed as best practice.</p>

        <h2>The Alternative</h2>

        <p><code>git push</code>. A webhook fires. The server pulls. Two shell scripts &#x2014; one
            to build, one to deploy. The entire process completes in seconds, not minutes. No YAML.
            No marketplace. No third-party actions with access to your secrets. No forty-five-minute
            wait. No $13,445 per developer per year in lost productivity.</p>

        <p>This is not a theoretical alternative. It is how software was deployed before the industry
            decided that deployment required a platform, a marketplace, and a configuration language
            that breaks on whitespace. It is how software is still deployed by teams that value
            their time more than their tooling.</p>

        <p>The pipeline stabilises a fragile stack. If the stack were not fragile, the pipeline
            would not be necessary. Fix the disease, and the ventilator becomes redundant.</p>

        <h2>The Verdict</h2>

        <p>CI/CD is a $1.73 billion industry projected to reach $4.53 billion by 2030. That
            growth is funded by developer hours &#x2014; twenty per cent of the working week,
            across millions of engineers, spent waiting for pipelines, debugging YAML, and
            trusting a marketplace that has already demonstrated it cannot be trusted.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The pipeline is not the solution. It is the longest-running workaround in
                the industry &#x2014; a forty-five-minute confession that the stack beneath
                it was never reliable enough to deploy with confidence.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Forty-five minutes per pipeline. Six hours per day. Twenty per cent of every
            working week. Twenty-three thousand repositories compromised through a single
            action. And underneath it all, a deployment that could have been two shell
            scripts and a webhook.</p>

        <p>The invoice is on the table. The ventilator is humming. Whether anyone
            asks what the patient is actually ill with is, as always, another matter
            entirely.</p>
